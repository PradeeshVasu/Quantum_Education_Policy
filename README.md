# ⚛️ Quantum_Education_Policy  
### *AI + Quantum Computing for Smarter Education Policy Recommendations*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Quantum_Education_Policy** (also known as **PolicyNav**) is a **FastAPI-based NLP web application** that leverages **Quantum Computing (via PennyLane)** and **TF-IDF text similarity** to recommend the most relevant education policies based on a user’s query.

The system integrates classical **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with **quantum-inspired similarity computation** to provide intelligent and interpretable policy recommendations.  

This project serves as a research prototype exploring how **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** can enhance information retrieval and text understanding for **education policy decision-making**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Policy Recommendations** — Suggests the most relevant education policies based on user queries.  
- ⚛️ **Quantum Kernel Integration** — Uses PennyLane’s 3-qubit circuit for quantum-inspired similarity.  
- 🌐 **FastAPI Web Interface** — Simple and elegant web UI built with HTML, CSS, and Chart.js.  
- 📊 **Data Visualization** — Displays region and policy status distributions dynamically using charts.  
- 🧰 **Robust NLP Backbone** — TF-IDF vectorization and cosine-based similarity implemented using scikit-learn.  
- 💾 **Model Persistence** — Pretrained TF-IDF vectorizer and matrix stored using `joblib`.  
- ⚙️ **Lightweight & Modular** — Easy to deploy, extend, and customize.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Quantum_Education_Policy.git
cd Quantum_Education_Policy
````

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📦 requirements.txt (Example)

```
fastapi==0.110.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.24.4
scikit-learn==1.2.2
joblib==1.2.0
pennylane==0.33.0
pennylane-numpy==0.33.0
jinja2==3.1.2

```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

You’ll see a clean web interface where you can enter a query (e.g.,

> "Improve digital education in rural areas")
> and receive the top 3 most relevant policy recommendations, each with region, year, status, and similarity score.

## 🧮 Core Logic Overview

### 🔹 NLP + Quantum Hybrid Model

* **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text data into weighted numerical representations.
* **Quantum Feature Map:** Encodes TF-IDF vectors into quantum states using amplitude embedding.
* **Quantum Kernel:** Measures similarity between quantum states to estimate policy relevance.

### 🔹 Backend Workflow (`app.py`)

1. Load pre-trained vectorizer + TF-IDF matrix from `.pkl` files.
2. Process the user query and normalize it.
3. Compute quantum similarity between query and all policy vectors.
4. Rank results by similarity score.
5. Render results dynamically in HTML via Jinja2.

### 🔹 Frontend (`index.html`)

* Responsive UI with gradient styling and flexbox layout.
* Interactive charts:

  * 🥧 *Policy Distribution by Region*
  * 📊 *Policy Distribution by Status*
* Displays top-matching policies as result cards.

## 📊 Example Output

**Input Query:**

> “Improve access to higher education in rural areas”

**Top Results:**

| Rank | Policy Title                        | Region | Year | Score |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 1    | Rural Education Development Policy  | South  | 2021 | 0.89  |
| 2    | Higher Learning Digital Access Plan | East   | 2020 | 0.84  |
| 3    | Inclusive Education Strategy        | West   | 2022 | 0.81  |
